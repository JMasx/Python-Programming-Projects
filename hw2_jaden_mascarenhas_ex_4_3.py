Homework #2, Excercise 4, Part 3
Name: Jaden Mascarenhas

Description: This program uses basic funtionality of python to 
             create a number guessing game with:
             Random upper and lower bounds &
             auotmated guesses.

             Bonus: I added a few additional features so that the automated guesses are more accurate.
                    In my testing, the autoGuesser gets the correct number 97% (in 97/100 tests) of the time.
                    In the unlikely event that it is unable to guess, the final guess will usually be within Â±0.5% (5 Numbers) away from the actual answer!
